Check out https://svn.cagrid.org/branches/djh-inventrio/wsrf-draft
and       https://svn.cagrid.org/branches/djh-inventrio/caGrid-OSGi
Build and install both of these.  All the dependencies should resolve through the inventrio repo.

Install servicemix 4.5
*NOTE: servicemix defaults to using the felix osgi kernal which has some bugs when dealing with complex feature/bundle dependencies, so let's use equinox by default
edit etc/config.properties, setting karaf.framework=equinox 
Make sure mysql is running, root / <nopassword>.

Execute the following on the console:
features:addurl mvn:org.cagrid/cagrid-features/2.0.0-SNAPSHOT/xml/features
features:install cagrid-dorian

The soap endpoint isn't installed by default yet, so
    install mvn:org.cagrid/cagrid-dorian-wsrf/2.0.0-SNAPSHOT

It may need to be started explicitly.

Hit http://localhost:7734/dorian?WSDL and you should get a WSDL.

Bring up gaards-ui, configured for http://localhost:7735/dorian.  It takes several minutes to connect.
The only thing you can do now is search for local users (look for username dorian).

grid grouper (see https://wiki.inventrio.com/display/cagrid/Grid+Grouper):
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Initialize Grid Grouper Database;
$> cd $PROJECT_HOME/cagrid-gridgrouper-internet2
$> mvn -P GrouperInit

Add GridGrouper Admin:
$> cd $PROJECT_HOME/cagrid-gridgrouper-service
$> mvn -P AddAdmin

features:install cagrid-gridgrouper
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


*NOTE: Depending on what version of Fuse/SMX you use, you may need to edit the etc/jre.properties to add com.sun.jndi.ldap to the system packages list

Reserved ports:
*NOTE: Each service needs two ports, the extra one for legacy clients.
