Check out https://svn.cagrid.org/branches/djh-inventrio/wsrf-draft
and       https://svn.cagrid.org/branches/djh-inventrio/caGrid-OSGi
Build and install both of these.  All the dependencies should resolve through the inventrio repo.

Install servicemix 4.5
Make sure mysql is running, root / nopassword.

Execute the following on the console:

features:addurl mvn:org.cagrid/cagrid-third-party-features/2.0.0-SNAPSHOT/xml/features
features:install cagrid-third-party
features:addurl mvn:org.cagrid.wsrf/wsrf-draft-features/2.0.3-SNAPSHOT/xml/features
features:install wsrf-draft
features:addurl mvn:org.cagrid/cagrid-features/2.0.0-SNAPSHOT/xml/features
features:install cagrid
features:addurl mvn:org.cagrid/cagrid-gaards-features/2.0.0-SNAPSHOT/xml/features
features:install cagrid-gaards
features:addurl mvn:org.cagrid/cagrid-dorian-features/2.0.0-SNAPSHOT/xml/features
features:install cagrid-dorian

The soap endpoint isn't installed by default yet, so
    install mvn:org.cagrid/cagrid-dorian-wsrf/1.0.0-SNAPSHOT

It may need to be started explicitly.

Hit http://localhost:7734/dorian?WSDL and you should get a WSDL.

Bring up gaards-ui, configured for http://localhost:7735/dorian.  It takes several minutes to connect.
The only thing you can do now is search for local users (look for username dorian).
