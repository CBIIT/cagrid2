* Two endpoint configuration is missing
* The non-singleton resource home stuff is not implemented (getDelegatedCredential needs to grab the EPR key to locate the relevant resource)
  - how does a "new" client get constructed to pass the EPR?
  - how does the new service-side pull the key out of the EPR context?
* once the above (epr) is done, the integration test needs to be updated to actually test getting the delegated credential, and test that the proxy-cert is working correctly
